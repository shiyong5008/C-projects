# Exercises

1. Explain: What do you think the Big-O (worst-case) complexity of the merge sort algorithm is and why? 

*edit your answer here for Task 2 question 1* O(n log n). Time complexity of Merge Sort is O(n*Log n) in all the 3 cases (worst, average and best) as merge sort always divides the array in two halves and takes linear time to merge two halves.

2. Explain: What do you think the best-case complexity of the merge sort algorithm is and why?

*edit your answer here for Part 2 question 2* O(n log n). Time complexity of Merge Sort is O(n*Log n) in all the 3 cases (worst, average and best) as merge sort always divides the array in two halves and takes linear time to merge two halves.

3. Does merge sort require any additional storage beyond the original array? If so how much and why?

*edit your answer here for Part 2 question 3* Yes. It requires equal amount of additional space as the unsorted array. From the code can see the copy of whole left and right array.

4. How much time in Big-O does it take to merge all of the subarrays together? Explain or draw why?

*edit your answer here for Part 2 question 4* O(n). To merge the subarrays, made by dividing the original array of n elements, a running time of O(n) will be required.


## Interview Prep (Optional +1% Bonus on assignment)

> This is for bonus--and you may not ask TA's, Professors, or anyone about the question until after the homework is due.

A bit ago a student asked me about this course, CS 5800, and other courses and how they may prepare you for interviews. I was recently talking to a Google, now Microsoft Engineer who told me that the reality is having a lot of LeetCode practice will help. LeetCode is a website to practice solving algorithmic challenges.

Let's finish off this exercise with a small C programming sample.

###

Solve the following: https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-sorted-array/

**Copy and paste your code into** a file in this directory called [challenge.c](./challenge.c) that solves the following problem.

**Given:** Two sorted integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, merge nums2 into nums1 as one sorted array and return the sorted array as a new array.

The number of elements initialized in `nums1` and `nums2` are *m* and *n* respectively.

Example 1:

```
Input: nums1 = [1,2,3,0,0,0], m = 3, nums2 = [2,5,6], n = 3
Output: [1,2,2,3,5,6]
```

Example 2:

```
Input: nums1 = [1], m = 1, nums2 = [], n = 0
Output: [1]
```

Constraints:

```
nums1.length == m + n
nums2.length == n
0 <= m, n <= 200
1 <= m + n <= 200
-109 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 109
```
