# Exercises

Discuss and answer the following questions (Make sure to elaborate and justify your responses):

1. What is the Big-O space complexity of an adjacency list?
1. What is the Big-O space complexity of an adjacency matrix?
3. What is the Big-O to search an entire graph using Depth-First Search (DFS)?
4. What is the Big-O to search an entire graph using Breadh-First Search (BFS)?

## Answers

1. *edit your answer here* O(V + E) where V and E are number of vertex and edges respectively.
2. *edit your answer here* O(n*n) for the matrix.
3. *edit your answer here* O(V + E) where V and E are number of vertex and edges respectively.
4. *edit your answer here* O(n*n)


## Interview Prep (Optional +1% Bonus on assignment)

A bit ago a student asked me about this course, CS 5800, and other courses and how they may prepare you for interviews. I was recently talking to a Google, now Microsoft Engineer who told me that the reality is having a lot of LeetCode practice will help. LeetCode is a website to practice solving algorithmic challenges.

Let's finish off this exercise with a small C programming sample.

### Clone Graph

Solve the following: https://leetcode.com/problems/clone-graph/

**Copy and paste your code into** a file in this directory called [challenge.c](./challenge.c) that solves the following problem.

Given a reference of a node in a connected undirected graph.

Return a deep copy (clone) of the graph.

Each node in the graph contains a val (int) and a list (List[Node]) of its neighbors.
