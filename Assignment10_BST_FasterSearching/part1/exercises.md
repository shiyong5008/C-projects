# Exercises

Discuss and answer the following questions (Make sure to elaborate and justify your responses):

1. What does it mean if a binary search tree is a 'balanced tree'?
2. What is the Big-O search time for a balanced binary search tree? (You may assume the binary tree is perfectly balanced and full).
3. Now think about a binary search tree in general, and that it is basically a linked list with up to two paths from each node. Could a binary search tree ever exhibit an O(n) worse-case search time? Explain why or why not. It may be helpful to think of an example of operations that could exhibit worse-case behavior if you believe so.
4. What is the recurrence relation for a binary search?
	- Note: Your answer should be in the form of: T(N) = aT(N/b) + f(n) (i.e. determine what 'a' 'b' and 'f(n)' are).

## Answers

1. *edit your answer here* A balanced binary tree is a binary tree structure in which the left and right subtrees of every node differ in height by no more than 1. One may also consider binary trees where no leaf is much farther away from the root than any other leaf.
2. *edit your answer here* log n
3. *edit your answer here* For searching element, we have to traverse all elements (assuming we do breadth first traversal). Therefore, searching in binary tree has worst case complexity of O(n).
4. *edit your answer here* T(n) = T(n/2) + 1, where T(n) is the time required for binary search in an array of size n. So in this one a=1, b=2, f(n)=1.

A bit ago a student asked me about this course, CS 5800, and other courses and how they may prepare you for interviews. I was recently talking to a Google, now Microsoft Engineer who told me that the reality is having a lot of LeetCode practice will help. LeetCode is a website to practice solving algorithmic challenges.

Let's finish off this exercise with a small C programming sample.

###

Solve the following: https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-search-tree-to-greater-sum-tree/

**Copy and paste your code into** a file in this directory called [challenge.c](./challenge.c) that solves the following problem.

Given the root of a Binary Search Tree (BST), convert it to a Greater Tree such that every key of the original BST is changed to the original key plus sum of all keys greater than the original key in BST.

As a reminder, a binary search tree is a tree that satisfies these constraints:

* The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
* The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
* Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.
* Note: This question is the same as 538: https://leetcode.com/problems/convert-bst-to-greater-tree/

### Constraints:

* The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 100].
* 0 <= Node.val <= 100
* All the values in the tree are unique.
* root is guaranteed to be a valid binary search tree.

### Example 1

> Input: root = [1,0,2]
>
> Output: [3,3,2]

### Example 2

> Input: root = [4,1,6,0,2,5,7,null,null,null,3,null,null,null,8]
> 
> Output: [30,36,21,36,35,26,15,null,null,null,33,null,null,null,8]

### Example 3

> Input: root = [0,null,1]
> 
> Output: [1,null,1]
