# Exercises

Discuss and answer the following questions (Please make sure to elaborate and justify your responses):

1. Explain what do you think the Big-Oh (worst-case) complexity of this algorithm is? Why?
2. What do you think the best-case complexity of this algorithm is?
   - Provide an example of an array of elements that fit the best-case.
3. Does insertion sort require any additional storage beyond the original array? Explain why or why not.
4. What is a 'stable sorting' algorithm? Is insertion sort a 'stable' algorithm, why or why not?

## Answers:

1. *edit your answer here for question 1* O(n2)
2. *edit your answer here for question 2* O(n), already sorted list, eg: [1,2,3,4,5]
3. *edit your answer here for question 3* no need. it swap data inside the array, so no need additional storage to copy a new array.
4. *edit your answer here for question 4* Stable sorting algorithms preserve the relative order of equal elements. Yes it is. As when compare the value, it not swap which maintain the original order for the equal elements.
